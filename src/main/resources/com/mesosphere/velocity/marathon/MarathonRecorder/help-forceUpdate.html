    <p>
        This parameter decides how to handle updating a Marathon application that has an active deployment.
    </p>
    <p>
        If this is set to <code>true</code> (checked), then a new deployment will be forced and the current deployment
        canceled. If this is set to <code>false</code> (unchecked), then this plugin will attempt to update the Marathon
        application every couple of seconds until a timeout is reached. If the active deployment does not complete within
        the time frame, then an error will be returned and the job marked as failed.
